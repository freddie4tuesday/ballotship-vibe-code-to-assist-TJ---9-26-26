# Ballotship — Roadmap

Things to work on, so nothing gets lost. Add an item as soon as it comes up. When one ships,
move it to **Done** with the build number that delivered it.

Each item: a short title, then one or two lines on what and why.

## Up next

_(nothing yet)_

## Backlog

- **Setup screen scrolls sideways on phones.** At phone width (390 px) the "Which team is at
  this screen" buttons (Team 1 / Team 2 / Moderator) are wider than the screen, so the setup
  page scrolls sideways. Present since the original file (checked against build 3), found
  during the build 4 visual check. Small layout fix: let those buttons wrap or stack.
- **Get TJ's test suite and merge it with ours.** The page's code says a test suite of TJ's
  exists that "run[s] a whole game in under a second", but it wasn't in the uploaded file. Ask
  TJ for it. We now have our own suite in `tests/`. If TJ's turns up, merge the two and keep
  the best of both, following the steps in `tests/README.md`.
- **Widen test coverage.** Not tested yet: turn-taking and one-screen modes, codes typed by
  hand, resuming after closing the tab, the AI-artifact requirement, the precedent reveal,
  timed auto-commit, and sudden death. Add these over time, or take them from TJ's suite.

## Ideas / maybe

- **Auto-delete relay rooms after a set time (e.g. 24 hours) — consider, not decided.** Left
  out of the relay on purpose for now. Why it's worth considering: the exercise asks teams to
  make convincing fake material (spoofed alerts, fake headlines, voice memos), and the game's own
  rules say to "keep it in the room, and delete it after the retro." Without auto-delete, that
  material and every written attack and response stays on Cloudflare until someone removes it,
  which is a privacy and misuse risk if a room name leaks. It also keeps storage from slowly
  growing. Why it might not be wanted: a facilitator may want the relay record available for a
  later debrief or report, and each screen already keeps its own copy of the thread, so the
  relay copy may be the only shared one. A middle ground would be a longer window (e.g. 7 or
  30 days) or a "delete this room" button for the facilitator.
- **Host the board art ourselves (someday, not soon).** The board image is loaded from a
  readyfortuesday.com upload; if that file moves, the board goes plain (the game still works).
  Low priority: this project is going back to Ready for Tuesday, and linking to their copy keeps
  the image under their control. Revisit only if the link breaks or before a high-stakes session.

## Done

- **Publish live at ballotship.electionadminsuite.com** — build 1.
- **Build number footer and change log** — build 1.
- **GitHub push access restored; work saved on `main`** — build 2.
- **End-to-end pipeline test** — build 2.
- **`main` made the default branch; old session branch deleted** — after build 2 (GitHub setting, no app change).
- **Relay Worker built and live at ballotship-relay.electionadminsuite.com; idle-pause cost guardrail** — build 3.
- **Our own automated test suite (`tests/`, 4 files, 50 checks, including a full game through the relay)** — after build 3 (tests only, no app change).
- **Plain-language additions: purpose line, "New to Ballotship?" explainer, "inject" definition, glossary** — build 4.
